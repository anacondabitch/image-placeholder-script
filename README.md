## Image Placeholder script

Quickly replace boring shapes by nice placeholder images.

### Install

- Close Photoshop if it's opened.
- Copy the script and placeholder folder to your Photoshop scripts folder.
- Open photoshop.
- The script will now appear on the File > Scripts menu.

### Creating a shortcut

I use the shortcut `CMD + SHIFT + P` (P of placeholder), It's available and easy to remember.
- Go to the menu Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts.
- Find on the list: File > Scripts > Image Placeholder
- Click on the shortcut column and press `CMD + SHIFT + P`
- Click Accept and OK to confirm.

### Using the script

- On any file, select the layer you want to use as the mask.
- Press the keyboard shortcut to run the script.
- The script will get a random image from the placeholder folder, resize it, place it over the element you had selected, and create a clipping mask.

### Customize

You can add and remove images to the placeholder folder and they'll work automatically.
The script supports JPG, PNG and GIF images.
